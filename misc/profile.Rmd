# profiling

Trying to do some profiling on very basic examples: why are they hard/what's going wrong?  (Should we try some monotonic splines via `scam`?)

```{r}
library(lme4)
library(lattice)
m0 <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (1|Subject), sleepstudy)
pp <- profile(m0, "theta_")
xyplot(pp) ## labels??
pp_all <- profile(m0)
xyplot(pp_all) ## labels??
```

**buglet 1**: what happened to the labels?

```{r}
pp1 <- profile(m0, "theta_", signames = FALSE)
xyplot(pp1)
(logProf(pp1))
```
